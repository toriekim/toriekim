## Hello, I'm Victoria... 👋

...but most call me Torie. I'm a Founding Engineer at Pagent, a social gaming startup where I build full-stack mobile experiences using React Native, Node.js, and AWS. I thrive in fast-paced, early-stage environments where I can wear many hats, make product decisions, and ship quickly.

My path into tech wasn’t a linear one. I started in publishing and hospitality, then pivoted into graphic design, and ultimately found a home in software engineering after graduating from the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Since then, I’ve worked as a teaching fellow, full-stack engineer, and now founding engineer — where I’m constantly learning, leading, and scaling.

⚡️ Currently: Building Pagent from the ground up
💡 Previously: Liftoff Mobile (Jetfuel), Fullstack Academy
📚 Always learning — most recently through open source, peer mentorship, and technical books
🎨 Outside of code: Watercoloring, cooking NYT recipes, making cards, and chasing the perfect noodle dish
😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
