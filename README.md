## Hello, I'm Victoria... 👋

...but most call me Torie. I'm an energetic, self-driven full-stack engineer. My background is in creative writing, literature, and publishing. After working in editing and hospitality, I decided to pursue a certificate in graphic design to diversify my skills. During this time, I fell in love with web design and coding -- I had finally found something that combined my creativity with my love of puzzles and problem-solving. So I applied and enrolled in the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, a 17-week immersive full-stack course. After graduating, I continued my journey as a Software Engineer first as a Teaching Fellow at Fullstack and then at Liftoff Mobile (Influence team, formerly Jetfuel) as a Frontend Web Developer. 

I love to challenge myself and have found that I thrive in dynamic environments. At the end of the day, I’d like to think of myself as a lifelong learner who is continuously growing.
